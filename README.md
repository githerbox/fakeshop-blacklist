# fakeshop-blacklist
list for WAFs and Adblocker like PiHole etc. to bypass Fakeshops provided by Instagram and Facebook..


###
As a regular user of Facebook and an occasional user of Instagram, I've noticed lately that Instagram only shows me fake shops. On Facebook, however, also in much rarer frequency.

I use PiHole myself, which is fed with appropriate filter lists, and yet I am still shown the above mentioned fakeshops.

This has led me to create my own blacklist, in which everyone is welcome to participate to expand it.
